### Hi there 👋 I'm freelance frontend engineer named TinyKitten.😺

I am a freelance front-end engineer. But I can also do the backend. Mainly we are developing TrainLCD, a smartphone app that reproduces Japanese trains.

In addition, I am making a A easy to use/deploy notebook system called "NoteNote" in my circle(TeamKitten).
